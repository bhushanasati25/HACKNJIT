### Inspiration
With limited resources and high patient volume, healthcare providers often need to make quick, data-driven decisions. The Patient Risk Stratification Tool was developed to assist healthcare professionals by automating the process of risk assessment using machine learning. The goal is to improve patient outcomes through proactive resource allocation, ensuring that high-risk patients receive timely care and support.

---

### Features
- **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Uses an ANN model to classify patient risk as high, medium, or low based on health metrics such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and smoking habits.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Provides personalized health recommendations based on risk level, including medication, exercise, and diet.
- **Patient Engagement**: Allows patients to track adherence to care plans and earn points for compliance.
- **Doctor Dashboard**: Doctors can access up-to-date patient information, view adherence to prescribed recommendations, and update care plans as needed.
- **Data Security**: Utilizes Firebase for data access control, ensuring only authorized users can view and edit data.

---

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: Firebase for access control and data storage
- **Deployment**: Heroku

---

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patient-risk-stratification-tool.git
   cd patient-risk-stratification-tool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Dataset**
   - Place the healthcare dataset (e.g., `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`) in the root directory.

4. **Run the Application**
   - Start the Flask application locally:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

5. **Deploy to Heroku (Optional)**
   - Follow [Heroku’s deployment documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deployment) to deploy the application for online access.

---

### Usage

1. **Train the Model**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/train` to initiate model training on the dataset. This will save the trained model and necessary files for future predictions.

2. **Predict Patient Risk**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict_risk` to access the prediction interface.
   - Input required fields such as age, BMI, glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and smoking habits.
   - The tool will output the predicted risk level and provide an explanation based on the input health data.

---

### Challenges

- **Data Quality**: Dealing with missing values and inconsistent data entries required significant preprocessing to ensure model accuracy.
- **Model Tuning**: Balancing the model’s complexity to achieve accurate results without overfitting was a challenging task.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Ensuring a smooth user experience required careful design and testing of API endpoints and frontend interactions.

---

### Accomplishments

- Successfully implemented an end-to-end AI tool that helps healthcare providers make data-driven patient assessments.
- Designed an intuitive user interface that encourages patient engagement and allows for real-time updates to health plans.
- Deployed the application on Heroku, making it accessible to a broader audience.

---

### What We Learned

- **Data Science in Healthcare**: This project underscored the unique challenges of working with sensitive healthcare data and reinforced the importance of accuracy and privacy.
- **Model Optimization**: We explored various machine learning techniques to find the best balance between model accuracy and efficiency.
- **Cross-functional Development**: Building a project that combines frontend, backend, and machine learning components required effective communication and collaboration.

---

### Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Personalization**: Add support for more personalized recommendations based on a wider array of patient data, including real-time vitals from wearable devices.
- **Expanded Medical Conditions**: Incorporate additional health metrics and conditions for a more comprehensive risk assessment.
- **Patient Notifications**: Add notifications and reminders to encourage patients to follow their care plans consistently.
- **Continuous Model Training**: Implement a feedback loop to continuously retrain the model as new patient data becomes available, improving predictive accuracy over time.
